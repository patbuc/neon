# ✨ Neon

A toy language you didn't wait for

## Why

Let’s be honest — the world doesn’t need another programming language.
I’m building neon for one simple reason: to teach myself a few things.

- How to build a compiler
- How to build a virtual machine
- How to use Rust for this

## State

Right now, neon doesn’t do much — it’s purely experimental and entirely useless and will happily crash in interesting
ways.

## Goal

I wanted to make neon self-hosted someday, but I am not sur anymore. Goals may appear (or disappear) as the project
evolves.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by Robert Nystrom’s brilliant book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
It’s one of the best reads in tech and I highly recommended it if you’re interested in the topic!

Go and get yourself a copy!

That said, neon won’t follow Lox, the language developed in the book. It’s taking its own path.
