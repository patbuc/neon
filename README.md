# Neon

Neon, a toy language you didn't wait for

## Why

Nobody needs another programming language.
I just want to teach me two things:

- How to build a compiler
- How to build a virtual machine
- How to use Rust for this

## State

Neon is simply useless at the moment.

## Goal

The primary goal for me is to make Neon a self-hosted language at some point.
Additional goals might come up during the development - or not.

## Inspiration

At some point I stumbled across Robert Nystrom's
book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), and it is one of the best books in tech. It's a
fantastic read!

If you haven't read it yet, and you're into building compilers & programming languages, go and get yourself a copy.

Said that, Neon will not follow Lox, the language Bob created for the book.

## Thanks

Thanks to [Robert Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com/) for his book üôè
